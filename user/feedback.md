## Discussing ideas and wishlist items

Please check [https://github.com/helloSystem/hello](https://github.com/helloSystem/hello) fist, including the [wiki](https://github.com/helloSystem/hello/wiki). Feel free to discuss ideas and wishlist items at [https://github.com/helloSystem/hello/issues](https://github.com/helloSystem/hello/issues), but please do keep in mind that in order to achieve the intended goal of simplicity, the team needs to say "no" to most wishlist items that do not further that goal.

## IRC

You can meet other helloSystem users and developers in the `#helloSystem` [Internet Relay Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) channel at `irc.freenode.net`. Please stay in the channel for a few days and do not expect to receive answers immediately, since we are all volunteers.
