# Providing feedback

## Sharing your experience

If you would share your experience with helloSystem on twitter, use the [`#helloSystem` hashtag](https://twitter.com/hashtag/helloSystem).

## Discussing ideas and wishlist items

Please check [https://github.com/helloSystem/hello](https://github.com/helloSystem/hello) fist, including the [wiki](https://github.com/helloSystem/hello/wiki). Feel free to discuss ideas and wishlist items at [https://github.com/helloSystem/hello/issues](https://github.com/helloSystem/hello/issues), but please do keep in mind that in order to achieve the intended goal of simplicity, the team needs to say "no" to most wishlist items that do not further that goal.

## IRC and Matrix

You can meet other helloSystem users and developers in the `#helloSystem` [Internet Relay Chat](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Internet_Relay_Chat) channel at `irc.freenode.net`. 

If you prefer using Matrix, then you can `/join #freenode_#helloSystem:matrix.org` from a typical Matrix client. This Matrix channel is [bridged](https://matrix.org/blog/2015/06/22/the-matrix-org-irc-bridge-now-bridges-all-of-freenode) to the IRC channel.

In any case, please stay in the channel for a few days and do not expect to receive answers immediately, since we are all volunteers.
