# Remote Assistance

The __Remote Assistance__ application allows a peer on the Internet to access and control your computer using the encrypted peer-to-peer Tox protocol.

## Receiving Remote Assistance

To get help form a peer, open the Remote Assistance application. Once a connection has been made, a long string is shown on the screen. This string has also been copied to the clipbord. Give that string to your remote peer, e.g., by pasting it into a mail or chat window.

## Giving Remote Assistance

As the remote peer (the person providing help), open the Remote Assistance application, and select "Give Assistance" from the menu. Paste the long string you received into the text box and click "Connect".

## About the Tox protocol

The __Remote Assistance__ application uses the Tox protocol to tunnel traffic. Tox is a peer-to-peer protocol that offers end-to-end encryption. The stated goal of the project is to provide secure yet easily  accessible communication for everyone.
