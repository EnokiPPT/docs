# Applications

Most applications in helloSystem come in the form of __application bundles__. An application bundle is an application that looks like a file but is actually a directory, containing not only the application but also auxiliary files such as icons and other resources. To view the contents of an application bundle, right-click on it and select "Open in new Tab".
