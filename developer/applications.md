# Applications

Frontend applications for system graphical user interfaces written for helloSystem should be
* Simple to use
* Easy to hack on
* Open Source (2-clause BSD licensed by default, but similar permissive licenses may also be acceptable)
* Ideally written in PyQt

Please see [https://github.com/learnpyqt/15-minute-apps](https://github.com/learnpyqt/15-minute-apps) for what we mean by "Simple to use" and "Easy to hack on".
